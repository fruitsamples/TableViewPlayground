 Abstract: 
 ATSampleWindowRowView implementation. This class is used because the NIB has an ATSampleWindowRowView placed in it with a special key of NSTableViewRowViewKey. NSTableView first looks for a view with that key for the row view, if the delegate method tableView:rowViewForRow: is not used.
